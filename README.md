# E-Ride


### **Project Introduction**
E-ride is a voice based ride sharing application developed with the motive of making transport services easier for visually impaired people.

The major feature that makes E-ride different from other ride-sharing applications is that it runs 
with voice commands. Visually impaired people can simply speak and find their ride in no time at 
all. They just need to tell the app where they want to go. The GPS can track their pickup location. 
Then any nearby rider will accept their ride request and head towards their location to pick them 
up as soon as possible. A voice automated system will tell visually impaired customers how far 
their ride is, how much it will cost them, the name of the driver, and many other pertinent 
information. Furthermore, it will aware the customer when the rider arrives at the pickup location 
and also provide OTP (one time password) which is only known by the rider and the customer to 
recognize each other. Hence, E-ride can make daily commutes very easy for visually impaired 
people.

### **Project Significance** 
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

• To help visually impaired people in effortlessly carrying out their daily commutes 
without requiring any kind of support from another person. <br>
• To implement secure and authentic ride-sharing service by providing the same OTP (one 
time password) to rider and customer which will help in recognizing each other. <br>
• To provide better accessibility features via voice automated system to all kinds of people. 
(especially visually impaired people)
